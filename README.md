# Project: Tic Tac Toe Testing

It`s a testing of the Tic Tac Toe game, where two players choose a mark and the fill in their respective mark on the 3 by 3 board, a player having three consecutive mark wins the game. If neither player achieves that, then it becomes a draw. This is a simple game with no AI functionality.

The tests are implemented using the Jest testing framework.
